  Project Description
  </div>
  <div class="text-xl">
  We are creating an educational video game, an “edutainment” game. The game should be entertaining and feature content suitable for middle schoolers. We have decided on using math equations for our educational element. Our game will be a take on the classic “whack-a-mole” game where players are tasked with solving as many math problems possible in a certain amount of time. The problems will appear on the screen and stay for an amount of time before they disappear. There will be positive feedback given to the user for correct answers. Players will type their answers into a text box, if any of the current questions on screen match the answer then that guess will be considered correct and the question will disappear. Points should be awarded, scaled depending on how many answers the player has gotten correct in a row. High scores are then stored after each playthrough to congratulate players for their achievments.

    Our Motivation
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl">
    The motivation for this project is to create an engaging way for middle school students to strengthen their math skills. We aim to make learning more enjoyable. We introduce educational content through a “whack-a-mole” style game, where students must quickly solve math problems that appear on screen. Systems such as scores, combos, and leaderboards are designed to encourage continuous improvement by rewarding accuracy, and speed. We believe that adding these competitive and customizable elements will help maintain students interest, making the game both enjoyable and educational.
