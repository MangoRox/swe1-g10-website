  Project Description
  </div>
  <div class="text-xl">
  We are creating an educational video game, an “edutainment” game. The game should be entertaining and feature content suitable for middle schoolers. We have decided on using math equations for our educational element. Our game will be a take on the classic “whack-a-mole” game where players are tasked with solving as many math problems possible in a certain amount of time. The problems will appear on the screen and stay for an amount of time before they disappear. There will be positive feedback given to the user for correct answers and negative, but still encouraging feedback given for incorrect answers. Players will type their answers into a text box, if any of the current questions on screen match the answer then that guess will be considered correct and the question will disappear. Points should be awarded, scaled depending on how many answers the player has gotten correct in a row. High scores are then stored after each playthrough to congratulate players for their achievments. We will code the game to have multiple difficulty levels to provide an accessible experience for all players.

    Our Motivation
    </div>
    <div class="text-xl">
    The motivation for this project is to create an engaging way for middle school students to strengthen both their math and typing skills. As computers increasingly become an essential part of our daily lives, it’s also increasingly important for students to develop proficiency in typing while also improving their speed and accuracy in solving math problems. By combining these two skills in an entertaining and interactive format, we aim to make learning more enjoyable. We introduce educational content through a “whack-a-mole” style game, where students must quickly solve math problems that appear on screen. Systems such as scores, combos, and leaderboards are designed to encourage continuous improvement by rewarding accuracy, and speed. We believe that adding these competitive and customizable elements will help maintain students interest, making the game both enjoyable and educational.
