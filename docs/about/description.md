### Original Project Requirements: [view](/.pdf)
We are creating an educational video game, an “edutainment” game. The game should be entertaining and feature content suitable for middle schoolers. We have decided on using math equations for our educational element. Our game will be a take on the classic “whack-a-mole” game where players are tasked with solving as many math problems possible in a certain amount of time. The problems will appear on the screen and stay for an amount of time before they disappear. There will  be positive feedback given to the user for correct answers and negative, but still encouraging feedback given for incorrect answers. Players will type their answers into a text box, if any of the current questions on screen match the answer then that guess will be considered correct and the question will disappear. Points should be awarded, scaled depending on how many answers the player has gotten correct in a row. High scores are then stored after each playthrough to congratulate players for their achievments. We will code the game to have multiple difficulty levels to provide an accessible experience for all players.
