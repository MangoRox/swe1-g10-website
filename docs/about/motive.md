# Motivation
The motivation for this project is to create an engaging way for middle school students to strengthen both their math and typing skills. As computers increasingly become an essential part of our daily lives, it’s also increasingly important for students to develop proficiency in typing while also improving their speed and accuracy in solving math problems. By combining these two skills in an entertaining and interactive format, we aim to make learning more enjoyable. We introduce educational content through a “whack-a-mole” style game, where students must quickly solve math problems that appear on screen. Systems such as scores, combos, and leaderboards are designed to encourage continuous improvement by rewarding accuracy, and speed. We believe that adding these competitive and customizable elements will help maintain students interest, making the game both enjoyable and educational.

This page demonstrates usage of some of the runtime APIs provided by VitePress.

The main `useData()` API can be used to access site, theme, and page data for the current page. It works in both `.md` and `.vue` files:

```md
<script setup>
import { useData } from 'vitepress'

const { theme, page, frontmatter } = useData()
</script>

## Results

### Theme Data
<pre>{{ theme }}</pre>

### Page Data
<pre>{{ page }}</pre>

### Page Frontmatter
<pre>{{ frontmatter }}</pre>
```

<script setup>
import { useData } from 'vitepress'

const { site, theme, page, frontmatter } = useData()
</script>

## Results

### Theme Data
<pre>{{ theme }}</pre>

### Page Data
<pre>{{ page }}</pre>

### Page Frontmatter
<pre>{{ frontmatter }}</pre>
