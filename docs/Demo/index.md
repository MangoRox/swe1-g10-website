# Mole Game Demo

This page explains how the **Mole Game** demo works and what a player will see
during a typical play session.

---

## What the Demo Shows

The demo is a small, self-contained slice of the full game. It highlights:

- **Core gameplay loop** – moles pop up and you whack the correct ones.
- **Math focus** – each mole asks the player to solve a simple math equation.
- **Difficulty ramp** – moles appear faster and as you build streak.
- **Leaderboard** - Your name appears on the leaderboard based on your score.

You can use this demo to quickly show the concept to instructors, testers, or classmates
without going through the full game.

## How a Round Works

1. Several moles pop up with **different short expressions** on them. For example: _“2x+8=10”_ .
2. The player must **whack the moles** by etering answer to the equation, before they disappear.
3. At the end of the round, the game shows:

   - The player’s score for that round
   - Streak acheived

## Controls

- **Keyboard (optional)** – Enter correct answer to the equations inside the box.
- **Pause** – Return to the main menu (if supported by the build).

## Demo Goals

The purpose of the demo is to:

- Show that math can be practiced in a **fun, game-like way**.  
- Demonstrate the basic **UI layout and art style** of Mole Game.  
- Give a quick sense of **difficulty progression** and timing.

This demo is not the full game – it is a focused slice meant for feedback and presentation.
